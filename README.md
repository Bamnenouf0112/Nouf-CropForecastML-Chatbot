## Project Overview
This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict crop yields. By analyzing historical agricultural data, the system generates forecasts that can assist in planning and improving agricultural productivity. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Features
- Predict crop yields based on historical data
- Support for various machine learning models
- Data visualization and analysis
- Easy integration with data sources

## Installation
1. *Clone the repository:*
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/Bamnenouf0112/Nouf-CropForecastML-Chatbot.git
   cd CropForecastML

2. *Install the required packages:*
   bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   The required packages that you should mention in your project README file are the dependencies needed to run your project. These may include:

1. Programming languages (e.g., Python, Java, Node.js)
2. Libraries (e.g., NumPy, pandas, React)
3. Frameworks (e.g., Django, Flask, Express.js)
4. Databases (e.g., MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL)
5. Testing frameworks (e.g., JUnit, PyUnit, Jest)
6. Build tools (e.g., Webpack, Gulp, Maven)
7. Version control systems (e.g., Git, SVN)
8. Operating system dependencies (e.g., Linux, Windows, macOS)
9. Other software dependencies (e.g., graphics drivers, external libraries)
   

## Usage
Start the application by running:
   
    ```bash
       streamlit run WEB APP.py

   Input Features
    Year: Year for which crop yield prediction is required.
    Average Rainfall (mm per year): Annual average rainfall in millimeters.
    Pesticides (tonnes): Quantity of pesticides used in tonnes.
    Average Temperature (Â°C): Average temperature in degrees Celsius.
    Area: Select the geographic area from the provided options.
    Item: Choose the type of crop from the available options.

   Example
   After launching the Streamlit app, input the required features and click "Predict" to view the predicted Crop yield.
   

## Models
The prediction model used is a Decision Tree Regressor trained on historical crop yield data. The dtr (1).pkl file contains the model parameters and is loaded during runtime to predict crop yields based on user inputs..
