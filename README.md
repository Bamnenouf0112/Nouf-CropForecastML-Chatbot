## Project Overview
This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict crop yields. By analyzing historical agricultural data, the system generates forecasts that can assist in planning and improving agricultural productivity. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Features
- Predict crop yields based on historical data
- Support for various machine learning models
- Data visualization and analysis
- Easy integration with data sources

## Installation
1. *Clone the repository:*
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CropYieldPredictor.git
   cd CropYieldPredictor
   

2. *Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):*
   bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   

3. *Install the required packages:*
   bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   

## Usage
1. *Prepare your data:*
   Ensure your dataset is in the correct format and place it in the data/ directory.

2. *Run the data preprocessing script:*
   bash
   python preprocess.py
   

3. *Train the model:*
   bash
   python train.py
   

4. *Evaluate the model:*
   bash
   python evaluate.py
   

5. *Make predictions:*
   bash
   python predict.py --input data/sample_input.csv
   

## Data
- *Source:* [Link to dataset source, if applicable]
- *Format:* [Describe the format of the data, e.g., CSV, JSON]
- *Features:* [List of features used in the dataset]

## Models
The prediction model used is a Decision Tree Regressor trained on historical crop yield data. The dtr (1).pkl file contains the model parameters and is loaded during runtime to predict crop yields based on user inputs..
